//We have come to a part where we will start making protected routes, ie pages where we only want logged in users to access, so before giving the response we will require something that can verify if the user is loggedin or not. Insted of writing that code everywhere, we will simply create a middleware(which is simply a function) which will run after hitting the endpoint and before giving a response and will make sure everything functions smoothly!ðŸ’œ
